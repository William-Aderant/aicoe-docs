Inference is the phase where a trained machine learning model is used to make predictions or classifications on new data. This is distinct from training, as the model's parameters are fixed and not updated during inference.

## Process

1. **Input Data**: Receive new data that needs predictions
2. **Preprocessing**: Transform input data to match training data format
3. **Forward Pass**: Run data through the trained model
4. **Output**: Generate predictions, classifications, or other outputs
5. **Post-processing**: Format and interpret the results

## Considerations

- **Latency**: Time required to generate predictions
- **Throughput**: Number of predictions per second
- **Resource Usage**: Memory and compute requirements
- **Accuracy**: Maintaining model performance in production

## Optimization Techniques

- **Model Quantization**: Reducing precision to speed up inference
- **Model Pruning**: Removing unnecessary parameters
- **Batch Processing**: Processing multiple inputs simultaneously
- **Hardware Acceleration**: Using GPUs, TPUs, or specialized chips

## Deployment Environments

- **Cloud Services**: Scalable cloud-based inference
- **Edge Devices**: On-device inference for low latency
- **Hybrid**: Combination of cloud and edge processing
