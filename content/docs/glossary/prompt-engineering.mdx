Prompt engineering is the process of crafting input text (prompts) to guide language models to produce desired outputs. It involves understanding how models interpret instructions and structuring prompts to achieve optimal results.

## Key Principles

- **Clarity**: Use clear, unambiguous instructions
- **Context**: Provide relevant background information
- **Examples**: Include few-shot examples when helpful
- **Format**: Structure prompts to guide output format
- **Iteration**: Refine prompts based on model responses

## Techniques

### Zero-shot Prompting
Asking the model to perform a task without providing examples.

### Few-shot Prompting
Including examples in the prompt to demonstrate desired behavior.

### Chain-of-Thought
Encouraging step-by-step reasoning to improve complex problem-solving.

### Role Prompting
Assigning a role to the model to guide its responses.

## Best Practices

- **Be Specific**: Clearly define the task and expected output
- **Use Constraints**: Set boundaries for acceptable responses
- **Test Variations**: Experiment with different phrasings
- **Monitor Output**: Validate results and adjust prompts accordingly

## Applications

- Content generation
- Code generation
- Data extraction
- Question answering
- Text classification
