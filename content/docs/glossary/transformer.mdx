The Transformer is a neural network architecture introduced in the paper "Attention Is All You Need" (2017). It revolutionized natural language processing and has become the foundation for many state-of-the-art AI models.

## Key Components

Transformers consist of:

- **Encoder-Decoder Architecture**: Processes input sequences and generates output
- **Self-Attention Mechanism**: Allows the model to weigh the importance of different parts of the input
- **Positional Encoding**: Adds information about the position of tokens in the sequence
- **Feed-Forward Networks**: Processes the attended representations

## Advantages

- **Parallelization**: Can process sequences in parallel (unlike RNNs)
- **Long-range Dependencies**: Effectively captures relationships across long sequences
- **Scalability**: Can be scaled to very large models with billions of parameters

## Applications

Transformers power many modern AI applications including:
- Large Language Models (LLMs)
- Machine translation
- Text generation
- Image generation (Vision Transformers)
