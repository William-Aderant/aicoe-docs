Fine-tuning is a transfer learning technique where a pre-trained model is further trained on a smaller, task-specific dataset. This approach leverages knowledge learned from large-scale training and adapts it to specific use cases.

## Process

1. **Start with Pre-trained Model**: Begin with a model trained on a large, general dataset
2. **Task-Specific Data**: Prepare a smaller dataset relevant to your specific task
3. **Selective Training**: Update model parameters (often only the final layers)
4. **Validation**: Test the fine-tuned model on held-out data

## Benefits

- **Efficiency**: Requires less data and computational resources than training from scratch
- **Performance**: Often achieves better results than training on limited data alone
- **Speed**: Faster to deploy than building new models

## Common Approaches

- **Full Fine-tuning**: Updates all model parameters
- **Parameter-Efficient Fine-tuning**: Updates only a subset of parameters (e.g., LoRA, Adapters)
- **Few-shot Learning**: Fine-tuning with very limited examples
