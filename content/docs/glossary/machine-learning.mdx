Machine Learning (ML) is a method of data analysis that automates analytical model building. It is a branch of artificial intelligence based on the idea that systems can learn from data, identify patterns, and make decisions with minimal human intervention.

## Key Concepts

Machine learning algorithms build mathematical models based on training data to make predictions or decisions. The process typically involves:

1. **Data Collection**: Gathering relevant data for training
2. **Feature Engineering**: Selecting and transforming input variables
3. **Model Training**: Using algorithms to learn patterns from data
4. **Evaluation**: Testing the model's performance on unseen data
5. **Deployment**: Using the trained model for predictions

## Types of Machine Learning

- **Supervised Learning**: Learning from labeled training data
- **Unsupervised Learning**: Finding patterns in unlabeled data
- **Reinforcement Learning**: Learning through interaction with an environment
