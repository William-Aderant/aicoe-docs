Cline is an open-source AI coding assistant that integrates directly into your IDE (Visual Studio Code and JetBrains). It operates as an autonomous coding agent capable of creating and editing files, executing terminal commands, and using browser automation—all with user permission at each step.

## Key Features

- **Autonomous Coding Agent**: Handles complex software development tasks step-by-step
- **Model Agnostic**: Supports multiple AI providers including Claude, GPT-4, Gemini, DeepSeek, and local models through Ollama or LM Studio
- **Client-Side Operation**: Runs entirely client-side using your own API keys, ensuring code never touches external servers
- **IDE Integration**: Native support for VS Code and JetBrains IDEs
- **Transparency**: Full visibility into every action the agent takes

## Use Cases

- Code generation and refactoring
- File creation and editing
- Terminal command execution
- Browser automation for testing
- Complex multi-step development tasks
