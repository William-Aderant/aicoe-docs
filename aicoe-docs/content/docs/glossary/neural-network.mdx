A neural network is a series of algorithms that endeavors to recognize underlying relationships in a set of data through a process that mimics how the human brain operates. Neural networks are composed of interconnected nodes (neurons) organized in layers.

## Architecture

Neural networks typically consist of:

- **Input Layer**: Receives the initial data
- **Hidden Layers**: Process the data through weighted connections
- **Output Layer**: Produces the final prediction or classification

## Types of Neural Networks

- **Feedforward Neural Networks**: Data flows in one direction
- **Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs)**: Specialized for image processing
- **Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs)**: Handle sequential data
- **Transformer Networks**: Use attention mechanisms for sequence processing

## Training

Neural networks learn through a process called backpropagation, where the model adjusts its weights based on the error between predictions and actual values.
